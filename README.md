# Campbell Centre for the Study of Animal Welfare data documentation library

Welcome to the [Schema library](https://agrifooddatacanada.github.io/CCSAW/) for the Campbell Centre for the Study of Animal Welfare.

This is a library of active schema projects.  As the projects are updated, documentation may be refined to reflect the contents.

Since we are working within GitHub, please note that the complete history of changes is available using GitHub Commit history tools.

## If you wish to add your schemas to the Library

With data that you have or intend to collect, describe your data using the [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org). You will download a .zip version of your schema which is a machine-readable version. Then on the main page of the Semantic Engine drag-and-drop your schema and generate a markdown version.

In [Schema library GitHub repository](https://github.com/agrifooddatacanada/CCSAW), upload your markdown file (which you can rename) to the schema folder.


After you have made your file changes, commit your changes and wait for the documentation site to rebuild before viewing your results on the [Schema library](https://agrifooddatacanada.github.io/CCSAW/).
